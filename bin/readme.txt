Hello Professor!

So for this project I have the base class Account and the two extends classes Savings and Checking. 

The test program asks the user for account information to start, this is used to create instances of the checking and savings accounts.

Then the user is asked how much they would like to withdraw and deposit. 

If the amount triggers the two withdraw flags then messages will appear and the withdraw amount will be set to the max.
